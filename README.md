# Thomas Wood

I am the director of natural language processing company Fast Data Science Ltd, which can be found at [https://fastdatascience.com](https://fastdatascience.com).

I am passionate about using data science and natural language processing to solve real-world problems. I have a MPhil in Computer Speech, Text and Internet Technology from the University of Cambridge, and I have worked on a variety of projects in the healthcare, financial services, and telecommunications industries.

I am also an active member of the open source community, and I have contributed to a number of open source projects, including the [Harmony project](http://harmonydata.ac.uk/) and the [Clinical Trial Risk Tool](https://clinicaltrialrisk.org) which was funded by the Gates Foundation and [won the Plotly Dash Apps challenge](https://fastdatascience.com/clinical-trial-risk-tool-wins-plotly-dash-challenge/) in 2023.

I am always looking for new challenges, and I am excited to see what the future holds for data science and natural language processing.
